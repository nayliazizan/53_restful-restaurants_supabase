this is just exercise that i did when learning fullstack engineer at codecademy. therefore, the whole code wasnt mine. i only put a few lines to complete exercise

goal of this lesson is to use server-side code to send HTTP requests to external APIs (supabase).

some notes briefly explain what code files are:
1. backend/routes' restaurants.js and starredRestaurants.js contain supabase provider n BE's routes w external API.
2. frontend folder contain FE code of app calls to BE routes, calls to external API.
3. ways, in terms using supabase:
   - create supabase db
   - create env file
   - connect to supabase using backend/provider/supabase.js
